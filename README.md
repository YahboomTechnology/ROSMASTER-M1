# Introduction
The newly developed ROSMASTER M1 by Yahboom is an omnidirectional mobile embodied intelligent robot designed specifically for robotics education, ROS research, and AI multimodal interaction experiments. It adopts Mecanum wheel chassis structure, it supports precise omnidirectional movement, enabling complex trajectory control such as lateral movement, diagonal movement, and in-situ rotation, providing an excellent experimental platform for path planning and motion control algorithm research.

ROSMASTER M1 can be equipped with various peripherals, including a 3D depth camera/2MP HD camera PTZ(optional), LiDAR, AI voice module, and ROS robot expansion board, building human-level 3D visual perception and environmental understanding capabilities. It supports Raspberry Pi 5, RDK X5, Jetson Nano 4GB, and Jetson Orin Nano 8G, and is fully compatible with ROS2 HUMBLE, deeply integrating with mainstream AI frameworks. Employing an innovative multimodal dual-model collaborative reasoning architecture, it efficiently integrates visual, voice, and text information, possessing human-like capabilities such as continuous dialogue, instant interruption, dynamic scene reasoning, and intentions speculation.

Whether conducting SLAM mapping and navigation, AI visual recognition, path planning research, or carrying out multimodal human-computer interaction experiments, this robot car can meet all your needs.
